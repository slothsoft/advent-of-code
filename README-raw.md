# Advent of Code

This is my try in solving the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges. Note that 
[puzzle inputs](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/copyright/inputs/) should not be shared.

Some of the challenges where done in a [JavaScript simulation](https://slothsoft.github.io/advent-of-code/).

## Possibly general algorithms

- 2022/12 Dijkstra
- 2022/07 FileSystem
- 2022/16 Permutation

## To-Do-List

- move algorithms somewhere safe
    - Dijkstra is in 2019-20 and 2021-15 and 2023-17
